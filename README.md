Web app to find your chance of winning at Texas Hold 'Em

A working version of this project is deployed at [poker-mc.ue.r.appspot.com](poker-mc.ue.r.appspot.com). 
It's run on a small free Google server, so please don't send too many requests or it'll break!

If you want to have your own personal version of this app running, use the code in the PokerApp folder. 
The easiest way to do this is to use Google Cloud Console:
1. Create a new project in Cloud Console
2. Set it up in App Engine
3. Download the Cloud SDK and make sure it works on your computer
4. Download the PokerApp folder to your computer
5. Go into that folder and type 'gcloud init' in your Terminal
6. When you're ready, type 'gcloud app deploy' to deploy the app!

If you don't want to go through this hassle, feel free to just use the website I've made. As long as not too many people use it, I don't think it'll have any problems. If you have any suggestions for improvements, feel free to contact me at my email!
